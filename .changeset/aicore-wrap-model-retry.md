Add a `wrapModel` hook on `createAgent` (`CreateAgentOptions.wrapModel`) so callers can wrap the fully-resolved language model (after middleware) as the outermost layer — used for retry/fallback. Also exports a `resolveLanguageModel(providerId, providerSettings, modelId, plugins?)` helper to instantiate a language model for any provider through the standard plugin pipeline; the optional `plugins` argument applies their `configureContext` middleware to the resolved model (used to give a retry fallback its own feature middleware).
