# KnowledgeVectorMigrator

`KnowledgeVectorMigrator` migrates legacy per-base `embedjs` vector databases into the new per-base 7-table `index.sqlite` store (`KnowledgeIndexStore`).

## Data Sources

| Data | Source | File/Path |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Migrated knowledge base identities and dimensions | SQLite `knowledge_base` | `knowledge_base` table |
| Migrated knowledge item identities | SQLite `knowledge_item` | `knowledge_item` table |
| Legacy loader metadata | Redux `knowledge.bases[].items[]` | `ReduxStateReader.getCategory('knowledge')` |
| Legacy chunk vectors | Per-base legacy vector DB | `ctx.sources.knowledgeVectorSource.openBase(base.id)` (streaming) |

The source reader is initialized by `MigrationContext` with `ctx.paths.knowledgeBaseDir`. It must read from the migration-resolved v1 userData path, not from the v2 path registry or `app.getPath()`. `KnowledgeVectorMigrator` itself should continue to use the reader abstraction instead of constructing vector DB paths inline.

## Target Storage

- Per-base 7-table index store at the migrated base's runtime path:
  `{knowledgeBaseDir}/{migratedBaseId}/.cherry/index.sqlite`
- Built through `createKnowledgeIndexStoreAtPath` — the same factory the runtime
  (`KnowledgeVectorStoreService`) opens its stores with (driver → schema → `ensureIndexMeta` →
  `KnowledgeIndexStore`) — then `KnowledgeIndexStore.rebuildMaterial` per item, so the migrated
  store is byte-for-byte one the runtime would produce. One `material` per migrated item; its
  legacy chunks become that material's `search_unit`s.

## Key Transformations

1. Loader identity remapping
   - Failed knowledge bases without a resolved embedding model are skipped at the base level; they keep their SQLite base/items and must be rebuilt after the user selects a new model.
   - `uniqueLoaderId` is not kept as a persisted field; it is resolved back to the migrated `knowledge_item` (the `material_id`).
   - `uniqueIds[]` takes precedence over legacy `uniqueId`.
   - A legacy vector row is considered valid only if it can be mapped to an existing V2 `knowledge_item.id`.
   - Unmapped legacy rows are treated as invalid index residue, not as business data that must be preserved.

2. Indexable item filtering
   - Only vectors mapped to indexable V2 item types are migrated.
   - Indexable types are `file`, `url`, and `note`.
   - A v1-indexed `directory`'s container-level vectors are normally **re-attributed** to synthesized per-file children (one `file` child per embedded loader id; see `KnowledgeMigrator.expandLegacyDirectoryItem`), so the folder stays searchable with no re-embedding.
   - Container-level vectors are skipped with warnings only as a **fallback** — when the legacy vector sources are unreadable, or an embedded file has no migratable vectors — and the folder is then kept as a migration-failed (`directory_not_migrated`) tombstone.
   - This does not remove the `directory` rows from `knowledge_item`; it only prevents container-level vectors from being written into the V2 store.

3. Material assembly (Route A — preserve the v1 split)
   - One `material` per migrated item; its `relative_path` is derived from the migrated
     `knowledge_item` via the shared `toMaterialRelativePath` helper, identical to the runtime
     indexing job — a file uses its stored `relativePath` (the processed-artifact path when
     present). A migrated url is pinned instead to the snapshot file materialized for it under
     `raw/` (frontmatter-stamped from `content.text`), replacing the item-id virtual path the
     helper would otherwise return. The store fills the rest of the row (`current_content_hash`,
     timestamps); there is no `origin` / `index_policy` / `file_ext` column and `content` carries
     no `text_format`.
   - The item's legacy chunk bodies are concatenated (in legacy read order) into one
     canonical `content.text` joined by the document separator (`\n\n`); each chunk becomes
     a `search_unit` whose `[char_start, char_end)` slices that text back to its exact body,
     plus a body `search_text` row. `unit_index` is the per-item read order.
   - This is a synthetic concatenation, not a fresh re-split: the first real reindex
     re-chunks with the live splitter and converges. The migration is logged per base.

4. Embedding reuse (no re-embedding)
   - Legacy `vector` payloads are decoded from `F32_BLOB` to `Float32Array` (end to end — half
     the resident size of `number[]`) and written through `encodeVectorBlob` (raw little-endian
     float32) into the `embedding` table, keyed by the body's `embedding_text_hash`. The bytes
     are identical to the runtime encoding, so no re-embedding happens and the store is
     engine-portable.
   - Identical chunk bodies (within or across materials) collapse to one `embedding` row.
   - Unsupported vector encodings are skipped under `unsupported_vector_encoding`, separate from truly missing payloads.
   - A vector whose length disagrees with the base's recorded `dimensions` is skipped under `dimension_mismatch` rather than corrupting the brute-force cosine scan for the whole base.

5. Identity regeneration
   - Legacy chunk row IDs are not reused; `unit_id` / `content_hash` / `search_text_id` are
     derived deterministically by the store from the material id, content and offsets.

6. Identity stamp
   - `ensureIndexMeta` writes the single `meta` identity row (schema version + base id) so the
     runtime opens the store without re-bootstrapping and rejects a swapped/foreign
     `index.sqlite` on a `base_id` mismatch. Build-contract snapshots (embedding model,
     dimensions, chunker config hash) are intentionally not stored — a model/dimension change
     creates a new base and a chunker change rebuilds the derived index.

## Memory Contract

At most ONE ITEM's text plus ONE BATCH of vectors is ever resident. `prepare()` streams each
base's legacy rows once (`openBase().reader.iterateRows()`), retaining only per-item rowid lists,
counts, per-reason skip tallies (capped samples — never one message per rejected row) and each
url/note item's reserved snapshot path, derived by point-reading that one item's rows back after
the scan (`PreparedBasePlan` deliberately holds no vectors or chunk text).

The rowid lists are the one deliberately retained per-chunk structure, and they **do** grow linearly
with the migration's total chunk count. Only their per-chunk cost is measured: one JS number per
chunk in a packed SMI array — 10.5 B/chunk at 1M chunks and 8.0 B/chunk at 10M (`node --expose-gc`,
heap delta around building `Map<string, number[]>`). What that costs against a real corpus is a
**typical-corpus estimate, not an upper bound the code enforces** — the migrator only requires
`dimensions` to be a positive integer, and nothing constrains `pageContent` length or a base's chunk
count. On an ordinary corpus a chunk occupies ≥5 KB in the legacy DB (a 4 KB float32 vector at 1024
dims + ~1 KB text), putting the plan at roughly 1/500 of the legacy file's size on disk: a 100 MB
plan would imply a ~50 GB v1 vector DB, and exhausting V8's 4 GB old-space would take ~400M chunks
(~2 TB source), against a heaviest observed corpus of ~75k chunks ≈ 0.7 MB of plan. A corpus of very
low dimensions and very short chunks shifts that ratio, so the retained plan is an accepted
trade — it buys per-item re-reads of the legacy DB instead of a second full scan — justified by v1's
one-chunk-per-embedding-call indexing never having produced anything near that scale, not by a
code-checked limit.

`execute()` re-reads
one item at a time: its text whole through the vector-free column projection
(`loadTextRowsByRowids` — the content schema stores one text row per material, so the joined text
is irreducible without a schema change), and its vectors in fixed ≤500-rowid point-read batches
(`loadRowsByRowids`) pulled lazily by `rebuildMaterial`'s `Iterable` embeddings input inside its
write transaction. url/note snapshot files are written during that item's turn, never buffered
base-wide, and decoded vectors stay `Float32Array` end to end (half the resident size of
`number[]`). The OOM history behind this: retaining every base's materials across
prepare→execute peaked at the sum of all bases' vectors (a 28-base corpus exhausted the V8 heap),
and the follow-up per-base re-read still loaded a whole base at once — which one large base (six
figures of chunks × high dimensions) could exhaust on its own, crash-looping the migration since it
restarts from scratch on every relaunch. The OOM regression guard test pins the exact
`PreparedBasePlan` key set and each phase's read shape (prepare streams; execute reads text via
the projection and vectors in ≤500-rowid batches — a 501-chunk item must arrive as 500 + 1).

## File-Safety Contract

- The migrator builds each rebuilt store **directly** at its runtime path
  (`{migratedBaseId}/.cherry/index.sqlite`) — no temp file, no rename. The rename
  was the migration's most fragile step on Windows: a SQLite store opened in WAL
  mode can keep the file locked past `close()`
  (`wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`, `PERSIST_WAL` and multi-second waits do not reliably
  release it), on top of an AV/Search-Indexer scan opening the
  just-written file without `DELETE` share. `MoveFileEx` needs `DELETE` access on
  the source, so the rename threw `EBUSY`/`EPERM` and the base lost its store. A
  retry only waits out a transient AV scan; it cannot wait out a handle `close()`
  never released. Building in place removes the move entirely — whatever lock
  lingers after `close()` is harmless because nothing moves or reopens the file
  here; the runtime opens it only after bootstrap, long after migration finishes.
- Building in place trades the rename's crash-atomicity (an interrupted build
  leaves a partial index at the runtime path) for that robustness. This is safe
  because the migration gate re-runs from scratch on any non-completed run
  (`verifyAndClearNewTables()` wipes the rows, `KnowledgeMigrator` re-mints a fresh
  uuid dir, the runtime never opens a store mid-migration), and the per-base catch
  wipes a partial on a caught failure. A crash-orphaned dir is never referenced by
  a `knowledge_base` row, so it is never mounted (dead disk, like the rename path
  produced). The `index.sqlite{,-wal,-shm}` family at the target is removed (with
  EBUSY-survivable retries) before (re)building, and the WAL is folded back into the
  main file via `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` so the runtime opens a
  self-contained store.
- A base is **published all-or-nothing**, and pinning its url/note rows to their snapshots is the
  last step of publication — the store counts as promoted only after that transaction commits.
  Anything that throws earlier (build, close, or the pin transaction) wipes the index and marks the
  base restorable-`failed`. Zero pins must not be credited as a success: a `completed` url/note item
  with no `relativePath` is the invariant violation `deriveConceptId` guards, and nothing repairs it
  — `index-documents` skips `completed` items so ensure-snapshot never re-captures, and a completed
  migration never re-runs. A `failed` base instead surfaces the restore flow, which re-adds the items
  into a fresh base whose rows are not `completed` and therefore do get indexed. That recovery is
  lossy for one case only: a url item re-fetches its live page rather than re-reading the `raw/`
  snapshot this migrator wrote but never pinned, so a since-dead link is not recoverable.
- The v1 legacy embedjs DB (`{knowledgeBaseDir}/{legacyBaseId}`) is **never**
  moved or deleted. Each migrated base gets a new uuid, so the rebuilt V2 store
  lives under a different path (`{migratedBaseId}/.cherry/index.sqlite`) and never
  collides with the legacy flat path — the legacy source needs no relocation. A
  user who rolls back to v1 after a failed, abandoned, or even successful
  migration keeps a working knowledge base.
- Retry is naturally idempotent: the legacy source is still in place, so a retry
  re-reads the original legacy DB directly via `KnowledgeVectorSourceReader`.

## IMPORTANT: Current Limitations

- A single base's failure is **non-fatal**, not a whole-migration abort. When one base's vector
  store cannot be rebuilt — whether `prepare()` could not read/map its legacy source at all, or
  `execute()` failed mid-rebuild or mid-publish — that base is skipped, marked a restorable
  `failed`/`missing_vector_store` row (so the UI surfaces a re-index entry), and the failure is
  surfaced as a warning — `execute()` still returns `success: true` and the remaining bases migrate.
  This keeps a per-base migration error from blocking the user out of the app: the failed base is
  recovered in-UI rather than by re-running the whole migration. The migration only fails as a whole
  on a structural/integrity error (a migrator throwing, or `validate()`'s reconciliation failing),
  never on per-base data that could not be migrated. **One exception:** if the base's own
  `failed`/`missing_vector_store` mark cannot be written to the application DB, the migrator throws
  and the whole migration fails. That mark is the only thing keeping the base out of the runtime's
  open path, so a migration recorded as `completed` without it would leave the base permanently
  unsearchable with no way back; failing instead lets the next launch re-run from scratch.
- After a successful migration the v1 legacy vector DBs (and the copied legacy
  upload files) remain on disk as orphans; disk space is not reclaimed. Reclaiming
  it is intentionally left to a separate future cleanup step gated on the user
  abandoning v1.

## Validation

Per successful base, the rebuilt store's row counts must match what was prepared:

- `material` count == one per migrated item.
- `search_unit` count == total preserved chunks across those items.
- `embedding` count == distinct embedding-text hashes across the base.
- Every `search_text` row must resolve to a stored `embedding` (zero uncovered
  units) — the migration-time form of the rebuild self-heal invariant: a unit with
  no backing vector is silently absent from vector search.

## Skipped Data

- Bases missing from migrated `knowledge_base`
- Bases marked `failed` or with `embeddingModelId = null`
- Bases with invalid `dimensions`
- Bases whose legacy DB file is missing, resolves to a directory, does not contain a `vectors` table, or becomes unreadable mid-scan
- Bases whose migrated id cannot be mapped back to a legacy knowledge base id
- Bases whose remapped legacy id is absent from the legacy Redux state
- Vector rows whose `uniqueLoaderId` cannot be mapped to a migrated `knowledge_item.id`
- Vector rows mapped to non-indexable container item types such as `directory`, **only in the fallback path** (unreadable legacy sources, or an embedded file with no migratable vectors); the normal path re-attributes them to per-file children instead
- Vector rows with missing or empty `vector` payloads
- Vector rows whose `vector` payload exists but is exposed through an unsupported runtime encoding
- Vector rows whose `vector` length disagrees with the base's recorded `dimensions`

A skipped **base** produces no store at all, which is not the same as an empty one. Every base-level
skip above is therefore marked restorable `failed`/`missing_vector_store` in `execute()`'s flush
rather than left `completed`, with two exceptions: a base with no migrated `knowledge_base` row at
all (`prepare()` iterates the migrated rows, so there is nothing to mark), and a base that is
already `failed` (it carries its own error — e.g. `missing_embedding_model` — which must not be
overwritten). The reason for marking is that nothing reconciles a `knowledge_base` row against the
filesystem: a `completed` base with no store gets a blank `index.sqlite` created and cached on its
first runtime open and returns empty search results forever, with no failed badge and no restore
entry. Recovery is the in-UI restore flow (which re-adds the items into a fresh base and re-embeds
them), not a migration re-run — the migration itself still completes.

If every legacy vector **row** under one base is skipped, the base is still planned and its rebuilt V2 store is expected to be empty (schema + `meta` row only). This is intentional: only vectors that can be proven to belong to migrated `knowledge_item` rows remain valid in V2.
