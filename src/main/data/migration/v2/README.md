## Path Safety — Use `MigrationPaths` (Strict Requirement)

> **⚠️ WARNING: Not using predefined paths may cause user data loss.**
>
> v1 users may have configured a custom userData directory via
> `~/.cherrystudio/config/config.json`. If migration code calls
> `app.getPath('userData')` or `new Store()` directly, on the first v2
> launch it will read from the Electron default path instead of the
> user's actual data directory — causing migration to be silently
> skipped or to migrate empty data, **making user data appear lost**.

All migration code **MUST** use the pre-computed path constants from
`MigrationPaths`. **NEVER** call `app.getPath()` directly or construct
paths with `path.join()` from scratch inside migration code.

| Correct ✅ | Wrong ❌ |
|-----------|---------|
| `ctx.paths.userData` | `app.getPath('userData')` |
| `ctx.paths.databaseFile` | `path.join(app.getPath('userData'), 'Data', 'cherrystudio.sqlite')` |
| `ctx.paths.legacyClaudeConfigDir` | `path.join(ctx.paths.userData, '.claude')` |
| `ctx.paths.legacyClaudeProjectsDir` | `path.join(ctx.paths.userData, '.claude', 'projects')` |
| `ctx.paths.claudeConfigDir` | `path.join(ctx.paths.userData, 'Data', 'Agents', '.claude')` |
| `ctx.paths.claudeProjectsDir` | `path.join(ctx.paths.userData, 'Data', 'Agents', '.claude', 'projects')` |
| `ctx.paths.knowledgeBaseDir` | `path.join(app.getPath('userData'), 'Data', 'KnowledgeBase')` |
| `ctx.paths.legacyConfigFile` | `path.join(os.homedir(), '.cherrystudio', 'config', 'config.json')` |
| `new Store({ cwd: ctx.paths.userData })` | `new Store()` |

`MigrationPaths` is resolved once at the migration gate entry by
`resolveMigrationPaths()` (including v1 legacy userData detection),
then passed through `MigrationContext.paths` to all migrators. If you
need a new path, add it to the `MigrationPaths` interface — do not
construct it inline.

### Narrow exception: application logger output

Migration diagnostics read the application's own logger output, not v1/v2 migration source data. This change
records one narrow exception to the rule above: logs **MUST** resolve through `application.getPath('app.logs')`
and **MUST NOT** be added to `MigrationPaths`. No broader migration filesystem access rule is relaxed.

## Migration Diagnostic Bundle

Only Renderer error/version-incompatible pages can request a bundle; there is no native preboot entry. A bundle
contains minimal system information plus a stable snapshot for one log date: prefer the failure panel's
mount-time local date, otherwise choose the latest eligible date, and never mix dates. If a complete snapshot
cannot be formed, publish metadata only and disclose that result in the UI only when the destination can still be
proven safe. If destination or source identity cannot be established, saving fails without replacing the existing
file. Metadata excludes failure stacks, paths, and run/process fields. Logs may be sensitive and must not be shared
publicly or outside Cherry Studio support.

## Renderer Export Memory

The migration renderer writes selected Redux Persist slices and Dexie records through bounded IPC chunks. Redux
is handed to main as a directory of category files, and localStorage export is restricted to keys actually owned
by migration mappings. Do not restore whole-state parsing or include `persist:cherry-studio` in the generic
localStorage export: either change retains duplicate copies of the same legacy state before migration begins.
Main owns the exact export paths: `migration:prepare-export` clears the registered staging directories before each
attempt and returns those paths to renderer. File-write, migration-start, and cleanup code must never accept an
unvalidated renderer-selected path.

## Version Compatibility Gate

Before the migration window is created, the gate validates the upgrade
path using `core/versionPolicy.ts`. This catches manual installs that
bypass the auto-updater's version filtering.

**Required upgrade path**: `v1.old → v1.last (≥1.9.12) → v2.0.x → v2.1+`

### Blocking rules

| Rule | Condition | Reason |
|------|-----------|--------|
| no_version_log | Legacy data exists but `version.log` is missing | User never ran a v1 version with VersionService (embedded since v1.7) |
| v1_too_old | `previousVersion < V1_REQUIRED_VERSION` | Data not in final v1 form |
| v2_gateway_skipped | `previousVersion < 2.0.0 && coerce(currentVersion) >= 2.1.0` | Skipped the v2.0.x migration line |

### Pre-release versions

v2.0.0 pre-releases (alpha/beta/rc) are treated as **before v2.0.0**
in semver ordering. This means:
- v1.last → v2.0.0-alpha is allowed (the gateway check uses coerced
  currentVersion, so `gte('2.0.0', '2.1.0')` is false)
- Pre-release → pre-release upgrades work because migration status is
  already `completed` after the first successful run
- The complete v2.0.x line is a verified direct migration target; v2.1.0 and
  later remain blocked until their migration compatibility is explicitly verified

### Path safety for version.log

The version check reads `paths.versionLogFile` (resolved by
`MigrationPaths`), NOT `VersionService`'s cached path. This is
critical for v1 users with custom userData directories — see the
Path Safety section above.

## Quick Reference

### Creating a New Migrator

1. Extend `BaseMigrator` in `migrators/`
2. Implement `prepare`, `execute`, and `validate`
3. Add it to the `getAllMigrators()` list in `migrators/migratorRegistry.ts`
4. Use `ctx.paths` for all filesystem paths — **NEVER** call `app.getPath()` directly

### Key Contracts

- `prepare(ctx)`: Dry-run checks, return counts
- `execute(ctx)`: Perform inserts, report progress
- `validate(ctx)`: Verify counts and integrity

`AssistantMigrator` also owns v1 assistant tag-group migration: it inserts `group(entityType='assistant')` rows and assigns their IDs to `assistant.groupId` in the same transaction.

### Foreign Keys Caveat

The engine keeps `foreign_keys = OFF` for the **entire** migration: `MigrationDbService` sets the
pragma once after migrations run. better-sqlite3 keeps a single connection, so that pragma persists
for the whole migration with no per-transaction replay. **Migrators must NOT toggle FK
themselves.** Verify integrity with `this.assertOwnedForeignKeys(ctx.db, [...])` at the end of
`execute()` (own, fully-resolved tables only — exclude cross-domain-deferred and shared polymorphic
tables); the engine runs a final whole-database `foreign_key_check` as backstop. See the
[migration guide](../../../../../docs/references/data/v2-migration-guide.md) for details.
