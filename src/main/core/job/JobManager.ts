   * a single failure (e.g. a malformed trigger) cannot leave the session with
   * zero armed schedules. `_isShuttingDown` is re-checked between every step
   * so a teardown arriving mid-flight short-circuits the remainder.
   *
   * Step order is significant:
   *
   *   1. `runStartupRecovery` resets non-terminal rows per handler strategy
   *      (abandon / retry / singleton) and honours `cancelRequested` overrides,
   *      EXCEPT rows this process is still executing (`inFlightExecuted`), which
   *      are excluded so a job started during the quiet window is not re-dispatched.
   *
   *   2. Resurrect queues for any non-terminal rows from previous runs so
   *      pending dispatch lands on the next tick. `dispatchAll()` iterates
   *      `this.queues`, which is empty on cold start — pending rows reset by
   *      recovery would otherwise wait until the next `enqueue` arrives and
   *      lazily ensures a queue. Walking distinct `(queue, type)` pairs lets
   *      pending rows dispatch immediately; delayed rows piggyback because
   *      the queue is in place ahead of the next `promoteDelayedDue` tick.
   *
   *      Concurrency consistency: `ensureQueue` here uses
   *      `handler.defaultConcurrency ?? 1`, identical to the `enqueue` path
   *      — cold-start resurrection cannot drift from steady-state behaviour.
   *      First-writer-wins: `ensureQueue` ignores concurrency when the queue
   *      already exists, so if multiple types share a queue name, the first
   *      `(queue, type)` pair from the SQL groupBy decides concurrency. No
   *      shipped type does this today, but the semantics live here in case
   *      future code does. `detectAndDispatchOverdue` (step 3) and
   *      `armSchedule` (step 4) both route through `enqueue`, which calls
   *      `ensureQueue` again on the same queue names — those re-ensures are
   *      no-ops thanks to first-writer-wins.
   *
   *   3. Catch-up FIRST, then arm. Two reasons:
   *        a. `detectAndDispatchOverdue` reads `lastRun` / `nextRun` from the
   *           DB and is independent of in-process scheduler state — arming
   *           order cannot change its decisions.
   *        b. If we armed first, a cron schedule with `protect: true` could
   *           still fire its natural calendar concurrently with our catch-up
   *           enqueue (`protect` only blocks overlapping callbacks, not
   *           external callers). Sequencing catch-up before arm guarantees
   *           the make-up enqueue lands before croner's first natural fire.
   *
   *   4. `dispatchAll` kicks per-queue pumps so pending rows reset by step 1
   *      start running immediately rather than waiting on the next enqueue.
   *
   * Pause interplay (write quiesce): a live pause hold short-circuits the
   * flow at every step boundary above — plus between per-schedule catch-up
   * steps — recording a resume cursor for the release compensation pass. A
   * STARTED catch-up step (one schedule's onMissed + catch-up enqueue) is
   * atomic and runs to completion even if pause lands inside its awaited
   * `onMissed`; drainInFlight joins the flow, so that enqueue always lands
   * before a drain verdict. `resume` re-enters from the cursor; completed
   * catch-up steps are never re-run (`computeCatchUpAction` reads
   * lastRun/nextRun, which catch-up enqueues do not update — a re-run would
   * duplicate make-up jobs). Shutdown still wins over pause and leaves no
   * replay debt.

   * elapses on the monotonic (libuv) clock while `promoteDelayedDue` compares
   * `scheduledAt <= Date.now()` on the wall clock. Both round to whole ms
   * independently, so a fire can observe `Date.now() === scheduledAt - 1`
   * (~0.4% of fires, measured). `scheduleOnce` self-cleans before invoking its
   * callback, so a missed promotion would otherwise strand the job in
   * `delayed` until the DELAYED_PROMOTION_INTERVAL_MS tick — up to 5 minutes
   * late in production, a permanent hang in tests (which never arm that tick).
   *
   * Cautions for future edits:
   *   - Do NOT close the gap by inflating the promotion cursor (e.g.
   *     `promoteDelayedDue(Math.max(Date.now(), scheduledMs))`): a row
   *     promoted before the wall clock reaches its scheduledAt is invisible
   *     to the dispatch claim query (also `scheduledAt <= Date.now()`) and
   *     would strand as `pending` instead — same hang, one state later.
   *   - Re-arm at the row's CURRENT scheduledAt, not the original fire time:
   *     the next delay is the exact wall-clock remainder, so the loop
   *     converges (strictly smaller remainder each round) and cannot spin.
   *   - Re-registering the same schedule id is safe by design:
   *     `registerSchedule` replaces an existing id, and `scheduleOnce`
   *     removed this id from its map before invoking the callback.
