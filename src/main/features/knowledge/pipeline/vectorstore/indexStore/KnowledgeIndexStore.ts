  /**
   * Delete many materials — each in its OWN short transaction — then sweep

   *
   * Removing each material row cascades to its `search_unit`; the units' body
   * `search_text` is deleted explicitly first (no FK), which also clears the FTS
   * index via the delete trigger.
   *
   * collectIndexGarbage runs two FULL-TABLE anti-join scans, so calling it once
   * per material (an old per-material delete+GC loop) made a bulk delete
   * O(materials × table): deleting a folder of N files scanned the whole
   * `embedding`/`content` table N times. With a large index (e.g. a folder of
   * PDFs chunked into tens of thousands of rows) that blocked the main-process
   * event loop for seconds — the folder-delete UI freeze. Deleting the rows up
   * front and GCing once makes it O(N + table).
   *
   * Batching the GC removes the super-linear cost, but the per-material row
   * deletes are still linear in chunks: each `search_text` delete fires the FTS
   * delete trigger, which the driver runs synchronously on the main process.
   * Tens of thousands of rows still sum to a multi-second block, and because
   * Electron drives the window from this same loop that block IS the macOS
   * beachball (the renderer thread never stalls). A driver transaction must run
   * fully synchronously (no event-loop yield inside `BEGIN`..`COMMIT` — see
   * {@link SqliteDriver.transaction}), so each material gets its own transaction
   * and the loop yields to the OS message pump BETWEEN them whenever it has run
   * for {@link DELETE_YIELD_BUDGET_MS}: the total work is unchanged, but no single
   * uninterrupted block is long enough to freeze the window.
   *
   * This is no longer one all-or-nothing batch — a failure partway leaves the
   * materials deleted so far committed. That is safe: every caller (subtreePurge.ts)
   * deletes vectors before the corresponding `knowledge_item` DB rows, so those rows
   * still exist after a partial failure and a retry re-discovers exactly the
   * materials still left (re-deleting an already-gone one is a harmless no-op).
