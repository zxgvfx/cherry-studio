/**
 * Knowledge base write tool — the destructive companion to the read tools.
 *
 * One tool with an `action`: add a new source (file / url / note), or delete /
 * re-index existing documents addressed by their Concept ID. The effective knowledge
 * base scope (the assistant's static binding narrowed by the composer's per-turn
 * selection, or that selection alone when there is no binding — see
 * `resolveKnowledgeBaseScope`) flows in via
 * `RequestContext.knowledgeBaseIds` and scopes which bases are reachable. Every
 * action mutates the base, so the tool is approval-gated
 * (`needsApproval: true`) — Cherry surfaces the approval card before it runs. The
 * mutation itself lives in the shared `knowledgeLookup` core so the Claude Code
 * MCP bridge runs identical logic (gated there by Claude Code's own permission
 * prompt); this file is just the AI-SDK `tool()` wrapper.
 *
 * `defer: 'never'` (kept inline, never behind `tool_search`/`tool_invoke`): the same rule
 * `mcp/mcpTools.ts` applies to force-prompt MCP tools. Deferring an approval-gated tool would strip
 * it from the SDK's tool-set, so the SDK's native `needsApproval` gate never fires and `tool_invoke`
 * refuses it too (it never runs an approval-gated tool blind) — an unreachable tool either way.
