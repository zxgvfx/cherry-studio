 * route; ModelScope nests repos under `models/` and defaults its branch to
 * `master` (HF uses `main`). One mirror table feeds two consumers:
 *   - transformers.js (embedding) takes the `{remoteHost, remotePathTemplate,
 *     revision}` triple as env values and fetches the model itself.
 *   - the OCR download service builds explicit per-file URLs from the same table
 *     via {@link resolveModelFileUrl} and fetches the weights directly.
 *
 * Download-time only. Embedding inference never consults this table: it loads the
 * cached model by absolute path, which is what keeps it off the network entirely.
