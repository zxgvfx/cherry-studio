 * One attachment the `read_file` tool may read this request, and an entry in the

 *
 * - `handle` is the **model-facing** name: normalized + made unique across the
 *   request (duplicates get ` (2)`, ` (3)`, …). It's what the model echoes back
 *   to `read_file` and the only name that resolves — so it must be stable and
 *   unambiguous.
 * - `displayName` is the original filename, kept for logs/observability.
 *
 * The internal `fileEntryId` never reaches the model *through this ref* — handles are
 * what resolve. Agent sessions separately announce managed paths, whose UUID filename is
 * the entry id; that disclosure is inherent to handing out a path, not a leak of this type.
