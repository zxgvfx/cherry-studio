/**
 * Bridge a Cherry {@link ProviderTransportAdapter} onto a pi provider config's
 * `streamSimple`, keeping the pi runtime generic.
 *
 * pi registers a provider `streamSimple` as THE stream for its `api` family
 * (`model-registry`: `registerApiProvider({ api, stream, streamSimple })`). We
 * make that `streamSimple` delegate to pi-ai's DEFAULT openai-responses stream —
 * the exact implementation pi would otherwise use — after injecting the
 * adapter's per-call `{ apiKey, headers, onPayload }`. pi never sees any
 * grok/codex specifics; the adapter owns "how to call me".
 *
 * The api-family functions are dynamic-imported in the connection's async
 * `start()` and passed in here (see {@link PiAiStreamFns}), because pi calls
 * `streamSimple` SYNCHRONOUSLY: `lazyStream` returns a stream immediately and
 * runs the async credential resolution behind it, so the fns must already be in
 * hand when that sync call happens.
