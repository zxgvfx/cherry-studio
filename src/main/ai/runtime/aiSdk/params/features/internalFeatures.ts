/**
 * Internal request features — one bundle per concern. Order matters because
 * AI SDK plugin order is significant (e.g. `reasoning-extraction` must run
 * before `simulate-streaming`). Mirrors the prior `PluginBuilder.buildPlugins`
 * decision tree, now expressed as `RequestFeature.applies` gates.
 *
 * Attachments (pdf/office/image/audio/video) are routed in `prepareChatMessages`
 * (`messages/attachmentRouting.ts`) — native inline or extracted text, with
 * `tools/adapters/aiSdk/builtin/ReadFileTool.ts` (`read_file`) paging the
 * overflow — so there is no
 * document-conversion middleware here.
