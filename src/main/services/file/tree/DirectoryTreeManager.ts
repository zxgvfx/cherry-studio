/**
 * `DirectoryTreeManager` — main-process bookkeeping for active `DirectoryTreeBuilder`
 * instances behind the `file.tree.*` IpcApi routes.
 *
 * Every `file.tree.create` call gets a unique `treeId` (the renderer needs
 * one to route mutation pushes), but identical `(rootPath, options)` pairs
 * **share one underlying `DirectoryTreeBuilder`** — one ripgrep scan, one
 * chokidar watcher, one set of FDs. This is the right place to dedupe
 * because the expensive resource lives on the main side; renderer-side
 * sharing would always pay an extra IPC round-trip per remount.
 *
 * A new consumer starts pending: its snapshot is returned with a baseline
 * revision while later mutations queue main-side. `file.tree.activate` flushes
 * that queue only after the renderer has installed its listener, closing the
 * snapshot-to-stream delivery gap without another filesystem scan.
 *
 * When a `treeId` is disposed and that builder's last consumer leaves, the
 * tear-down is deferred by `DISPOSE_GRACE_MS`. React commits effects in
 * order "deletions before insertions" within a single commit — when a keyed
 * consumer is replaced or a tab unmounts and immediately remounts, the unmount fires
 * `file.tree.dispose` for the old id and the mount fires `file.tree.create` for the
 * new id back-to-back. The grace window lets the new call grab the still-
 * warm builder instead of waiting on a fresh scan + watcher install.
 *
 * Renderer→main IPC sequence on a same-commit consumer replacement:
 *   T0     unmount   file.tree.dispose(old)  → refcount=0, grace timer queued
 *   T0+ε   mount     file.tree.create(...)   → cancels timer, attaches as new consumer
