/**
 * Renderer-side send-time bridge: turn the composer's `ComposerAttachment`s
 * into v2 `FileUIPart`s that survive userData moves.
 *
 * The composer holds lean `ComposerAttachment` descriptors; the v2 `FileEntry`
 * is created here, when the message is actually sent. Each attachment is
 * promoted to an internal `FileEntry` via `createInternalEntry` (Cherry copies
 * the bytes into its own storage); the resulting `fileEntryId` and the
 * composer's stable `fileTokenSourceId` live in `providerMetadata.cherry` so
 * downstream consumers can identify both the stored file and its composer
 * token association — see `packages/shared/data/types/uiParts.ts` for the
 * accessor + Zod.

 * For each `ComposerAttachment`, create a v2 internal FileEntry (Cherry copies

 * `fileEntryId` plus a `file://` URL pointing at the freshly-copied physical file.
 *
 * `ComposerAttachment.path` is already an `AbsoluteFilePath` — producers validate
 * it — so the only precondition left here is that the path is *present*: an
 * attachment reconstructed for message editing carries none, and such an
 * attachment must never be re-sent through `createInternalEntry` (the edit flow
 * reuses the original part instead).
 *
 * That check runs over the WHOLE batch before the first IPC. `createInternalEntry`
 * copies bytes and inserts a row, and neither orphan sweep reclaims the result
 * (the DB sweep only reports zero-ref entries; the FS sweep only unlinks files
 * with no DB row), so a mid-flight rejection would leave permanent residue that
 * every retry duplicates.
 *
 * A rejected `createInternalEntry` still leaves that residue — this batch is not
 * atomic — but that failure mode is independent of the caller's input.
