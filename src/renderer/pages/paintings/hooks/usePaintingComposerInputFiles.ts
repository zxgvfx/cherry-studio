 *
 * - SEED: when the painting changes, project its `inputFiles` onto composer
 *   attachments so existing input images render as file chips, and prime the
 *   source-id→entry cache so a re-opened input maps back to its existing entry.
 * - MATERIALIZE: `materializeInputs()` is called at generate time (mirroring chat's
 *   send-time `buildFileParts`), NOT eagerly during the draft. It promotes each
 *   composer attachment to a `FileEntry` (`createInternalEntry source:'path'`,
 *   cached by token source id so a seeded/promoted attachment never re-imports its
 *   bytes) and returns the resolved list plus a `complete` flag. Nothing is written
 *   to the DB during the draft window, so the cleanup reaper has no unreferenced
 *   input row to reclaim. Contract: an incomplete set (`complete: false`, some
 *   attachment failed to promote) must never reach generation — the caller aborts.
 * - CLEAR: a same-painting model switch does NOT remount the composer (the provider
 *   is keyed on painting id only), so SEED never re-runs to reconcile `switchModel`
 *   dropping `inputFiles`. This effect is that reconciliation: switching to a model
 *   that can't accept images (`accept`→`reject`) clears the draft. Switching
 *   provider (or edit→edit) while capability stays `accept` keeps the chips — the
 *   uploaded reference image is still valid for the next edit-capable model.
 *
 * SEED and CLEAR are separate effects racing over the same draft, so both go through
 * `draftEpochRef`: CLEAR bumps it, SEED refuses to commit results from a superseded
 * epoch. See the ref's own comment for the failure it prevents.
 *
 * Note the draft is *only* the next request's inputs. `painting.inputFiles` is the
 * archive of the run that produced `painting.files`; SEED projects it into the tray
 * as a starting point, and nothing writes back to it outside `generate`.
