/**
 * Vendor identity regex patterns — the single source of truth for
 * "which vendor does this raw model ID belong to".
 *
 * Shared across three call sites:
 *  - `@shared/utils/model` — vendor check functions (`isAnthropicModel`
 *    etc.) and capability inference (e.g. deciding which IDs to mark
 *    `REASONING` in the schema).
 *  - `@cherrystudio/ui` icon registry — vendor-level icon routing for
 *    models whose ID doesn't have a dedicated SKU icon.
 *  - Future callers doing vendor dispatch.
 *
 * Keeping these regex in the registry layer means both capability
 * inference and icon lookup stay in lockstep when a new vendor /
 * naming convention lands.
 *
 * Scope: **vendor identity only**. SKU-level patterns (`gpt-5.1-codex-mini`,
 * `claude-sonnet-4-6`, etc.) stay in their specific consumer modules —
 * those are dispatch details rather than shared vendor taxonomy.
 *
 * Normalization note: patterns assume the id has already been lowercased
 * and had the leading namespace stripped (e.g. `deepseek/deepseek-r1` →
 * `deepseek-r1`). Pair with `getLowerBaseModelName` (in `@shared`) or
 * `normalizeModelId` (in this package).
 */

/**
 * Match raw model IDs to their vendor. Keys are vendor slugs; order is
 * not significant because every pattern is anchored to the start of the
 * (namespace-stripped) id, so they stay mutually exclusive — a model
 * belongs to at most one vendor. Keep new patterns anchored (`^…`) so a
 * cross-vendor id like `deepseek-grok` resolves by its leading token, not
 * by insertion order.
