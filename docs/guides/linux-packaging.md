# Linux Packaging

Linux packages use x64 and ARM64 `better-sqlite3` prebuilds from the pinned
[`CherryHQ/cherry-studio-better-sqlite3`](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio-better-sqlite3) GitHub Release.

## Build

```bash
# Build both architectures
pnpm build:linux

# Build one architecture
pnpm build:linux:x64
pnpm build:linux:arm64
```

The first build requires network access to populate the Git-ignored `scripts/linux-native/prebuilt/` cache. Cherry
Studio packaging itself does not require Docker or QEMU; those tools are only needed when publishing new prebuilds
from the separate repository.

## Packaging Flow

1. `beforePack` downloads the target artifact and verifies its pinned Release checksum.
2. electron-builder performs its normal native dependency rebuild.
3. `afterPack` verifies the Electron ABI, module version, ELF architecture, checksum, and maximum
   GLIBC/GLIBCXX/CXXABI requirements before replacing the packaged `better_sqlite3.node`.

A missing, stale, or incompatible artifact stops packaging.

## Updating the Prebuild

When Electron or `better-sqlite3` changes:

1. Publish a verified Release from the prebuild repository.
2. Update `scripts/linux-native/release.json` with the exact tag, filenames, metadata, and SHA-256 values.

Never point application builds at a floating `latest` Release.
