# Job & Scheduler — Architecture Overview

Two independent main-process lifecycle services:

| Service | Role | Persistence | Direct consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SchedulerService** | "When to fire a callback" — cron / interval / once. Stateless. | None | JobManager + any module needing simple time scheduling |
| **JobManager** | "Job lifecycle" — registry, persistence, 6-state machine, dispatch, recovery | `jobTable` + `jobScheduleTable` | All background work |

**Layering rule**: SchedulerService is unaware of Jobs. JobManager uses SchedulerService to arm schedules. Business modules pick one based on need:

- Need cron + persistent observability + retry → register a JobHandler + use `jobManager.registerJobSchedule()`
- Need cron only (heartbeat-style, no persistence) → `schedulerService.registerSchedule()` directly
- Need recurring service-internal GC / self-check → `BaseService.registerInterval` (project convention, not SchedulerService)

## DB-driven dispatch

`jobTable` is the **single source of truth**. Memory state (handlers Map, queues Map, AbortControllers) is a derived view that JobManager rebuilds on every startup.

Each queue has a `DispatchQueue` instance holding `{ name, concurrency, mutex }`. The dispatch loop (`JobManager.dispatch`):

1. Acquire **Layer 1** per-queue mutex *first*
2. Enter **Layer 0** — the synchronous `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` write transaction (`withWriteTx`) — *second*
3. Inside that one DB transaction:
   - Count queue-active jobs → check `queue.concurrency`
   - Count globally-running jobs → check `globalMaxConcurrency`
   - SELECT next pending → UPDATE to running (claim)
4. The Layer 0 transaction commits, then release the Layer 1 per-queue mutex
5. Spawn `handler.execute` outside the lock
6. Queue a microtask to dispatch the same queue again (fill next slot)

Spawning happens *outside* the lock — the handler executes for seconds/minutes while new dispatches proceed.

**Acquisition order is fixed** (Layer 1 mutex, then the Layer 0 write transaction). Layer 0 holds no async lock — it is a synchronous transaction — so Layer 1 is the only mutex in the dispatch path and the two layers cannot deadlock against each other.

## Six-state state machine

```
                  ┌── retry backoff (delayed) ──┐
                  ▼                              │
   enqueue → pending → running → completed       │
                  │       │                      │
                  │       └→ failed ─────────────┘ (if retryable && attempt < max)
                  │       └→ cancelled (terminal)
                  └→ delayed → (scheduledAt ≤ now) → pending
```

Terminal states (`completed` / `failed` / `cancelled`) are never reopened. Retry re-enters `delayed` then transitions back to `pending` when scheduledAt elapses.

## Startup Recovery

Startup recovery is JobManager's deferred sweep that reconciles the DB-driven state machine with the freshly booted process. It is service-level business work, **not** a bootstrap initialization side effect — see [onAllReady business work pattern](../lifecycle/lifecycle-usage.md#onallready-business-work-pattern) for the framework-level rationale.

**Sequence**

1. `JobManager.onAllReady()` schedules a `setTimeout` with a 60-second "quiet window" and returns synchronously. `LifecycleManager.allReady()` is fire-and-forget; bootstrap is not blocked.
2. After 60 s, the timer callback assigns the recovery flow promise to `this._recoveryDone` (only if shutdown has not been requested) and the flow starts running.
3. The flow runs four IO steps in order:
   1. `runStartupRecovery(handlers, isJobInFlight)` — resets non-terminal rows per handler recovery strategy (`abandon` / `retry` / `singleton`); `cancelRequested=true` overrides every strategy. Rows the current process is **already executing** (reported via `isJobInFlight`, backed by `JobManager.inFlightExecuted`) are excluded before any strategy, so a job enqueued during the quiet window and still running when the sweep fires is never reset or re-dispatched (#16291).
   2. **Resurrect queues** — walks distinct `(queue, type)` pairs over non-terminal rows and ensures a `DispatchQueue` exists for each. Without this step `dispatchAll` would iterate an empty `queues` map and pending rows would wait until the next `enqueue`.
   3. **Catch-up THEN arm** — calls `detectAndDispatchOverdue(schedules)` *before* `armSchedule(schedule)` for every enabled schedule. The order is load-bearing: if we armed first, a cron with `protect: true` could fire its natural calendar concurrently with a catch-up enqueue (`protect` only blocks overlapping callbacks, not external callers). Sequencing catch-up first guarantees the make-up enqueue lands before croner's first natural fire.
   4. `dispatchAll()` kicks every per-queue pump so pending rows reset by step 1 start running immediately rather than waiting on the next enqueue.

**The 60 s quiet window**

The delay (`JOB_MANAGER_STARTUP_DELAY_MS = 60_000`, hardcoded) gives cold-start IO — DB warm-up, window paints, client bootstrap — time to settle before scheduled work piles on. Tests bypass it via `vi.useFakeTimers + advanceTimersByTimeAsync(60_000)`, then await `_recoveryDone`.

**Shutdown safety — three layers**

The flow can be interrupted at any point by `onStop`. Three mechanisms cooperate:

| Window | Defence |
|---|---|
| Quiet window (timer not yet fired) | `registerDisposable(() => clearTimeout(handle))` clears the timer during `_cleanupDisposables`; the callback also re-checks `_isShuttingDown` so a teardown that races with `clearTimeout` is still safe. |
| Flow mid-flight | Every IO step re-checks `_isShuttingDown` before the next `await`, returning early on shutdown. |
| Flow already started | `onStop` awaits `this._recoveryDone` before tearing down resources, so the current step finishes gracefully before queues, abort controllers, and disposables are released. The join is unconditional on purpose — racing it against a deadline would let the teardown run while recovery is still writing. |

The join is bounded from the outside: shutdown caps every service at `SERVICE_STOP_TIMEOUT_MS` (5s). If the in-flight recovery step outlasts that, the framework stops waiting on JobManager and moves on — no `SERVICE_STOPPED`, and the pass is recorded as unclean. The teardown after the join still runs whenever recovery does finish, just too late to count: it now overlaps the shutdown of services further down the order. Whether `onDestroy` still runs on top of it depends on that late finish beating `destroyAll()` to JobManager — a race, not a guarantee (see [Lifecycle Overview — teardown time contract](../lifecycle/lifecycle-overview.md#teardown-time-contract)). Acceptable either way because none of it is load-bearing — enqueue writes to the DB immediately and startup recovery repairs whatever was left mid-flight.

**Handler registration timing**

Handlers must be registered in the owning service's `onInit` (see [handler-authoring.md — Registration Timing](./handler-authoring.md#registration-timing)). By the time the 60-second timer fires every consumer has finished `onInit` / `onReady`, so `runStartupRecovery` sees the full handler set. Registering a handler from another service's `onAllReady` is unsafe: that hook runs in parallel with JobManager's, and any non-terminal job for an unregistered type during recovery gets treated as an orphan and cancelled.

## Pause and drain (write quiesce)

Serves backup restore (#16850): after the restore snapshot is taken at time T, any JobManager write to the old live DB fails the fingerprint re-check and wastes the whole restore attempt. `pause()` stops **autonomous** writes to avoid that waste; the fingerprint gate stays the correctness backstop. The restore orchestrator must NOT run as a JobManager job — a handler that pauses and drains its own manager deadlocks until timeout.

```ts
const hold = jobManager.pause('backup restore')
const verdict = await jobManager.drainInFlight({ timeoutMs: 15_000 })
const clean = verdict.stragglerIds.length === 0 && !verdict.startupRecoveryPending
if (!clean) {
  hold.dispose() // abort path ONLY — give the manager back its autonomy
  return abortRestoreAttempt()
}
await createSnapshot()
// Happy path: NEVER dispose. The release pass writes to the old live DB
// (promotion, markFired, catch-up enqueues) — post-snapshot that fails the
// fingerprint re-check and voids the attempt. The hold stands until the
// process relaunches into the restored DB (a lost hold fails closed).
```

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| No `resume()` | Release = dispose your own hold. Holds are refcounted; the last dispose runs the compensation pass: any outstanding recovery settles FIRST — an internal release barrier keeps autonomous fires/claims frozen until it does (interval chains and croner timers would otherwise resume the moment the holds are gone and race the flow's stale-snapshot catch-up) — then delayed promotion + dispatch, suppressed-once re-arm, croner resume. A lost hold fails closed — paused until relaunch. |
| Drain precondition | Caller must hold a live pause hold. Without one the verdict is a point-in-time snapshot (warn, no throw) and MUST NOT gate a DB snapshot. |
| Clean verdict | `stragglerIds` empty **and** `startupRecoveryPending === false`. The deferred startup recovery is a JM-internal writer that is not a job, so it gets its own verdict field — never fake ids in `stragglerIds`. `true` means the flow is still blocked inside a step; a flow that short-circuited at a step boundary writes nothing more and reports `false` (the remainder is release's debt). |
| Timeout | `drainInFlight` never rejects. Stragglers are **not** aborted — an abort settles them as `cancelled` into the snapshot and they would never re-run after a restore; left `running`, startup recovery applies the handler strategy. Orchestrator rule: any drain timeout → abort the restore attempt. |
| No error surface | No API throws because of a pause; there is no pause-related error code. |

**Blocked while paused** (autonomous writes): dispatch claims (entry check + post-mutex re-check), schedule fire callbacks (crons are additionally paused at the croner layer so `limit` quotas survive the window), GC / delayed-promotion ticks, delayed/retry promotion fires, and new startup-recovery steps — a started step (one schedule's `onMissed` + catch-up enqueue, atomic) runs to completion and is awaited by drain.

**Allowed while paused** (request-driven): `enqueue` / `enqueueTx` (rows land at rest and the snapshot captures them), `cancel` / `cancelMany`, schedule mutations, and `triggerJobScheduleNow*` — forced onto its direct-enqueue fallback (row lands `pending` + `markFired`; `true` still means "row persisted").

Missed cron fires are skipped, not caught up (croner semantics). A suppressed `once` fire is re-armed on release from the recorded id set — exactly once; never rebuild by scanning "enabled ∧ missing scheduler entry", which also matches historical completed one-shots.

## Why DB-driven and not in-memory queue?

We considered BullMQ / bee-queue / better-queue / agenda / graphile-worker / bree etc. and selected this design because:

- All persistence already in SQLite (no Redis / MongoDB / PostgreSQL dependency)
- Restart recovery is automatic — memory replays from DB
- Race safety needs only one mutex pair (Layer 0 + Layer 1) around `count → claim`
- No double-source-of-truth bookkeeping (PQueue + DB) and its sync discipline

Throughput: ~200 dispatch/s at single-process better-sqlite3 throughput, well above Cherry Studio's largest scenario (1000+ knowledge bases, each with concurrency=5, never exceeds globalMaxConcurrency=50 simultaneous running jobs).

## Strongly-typed JobRegistry

Business modules use TypeScript declaration merging to register `type → payload` mapping:

```typescript
declare module '@main/core/job/jobRegistry' {
  interface JobRegistry {
    'agent.task': AgentTaskPayload
    'knowledge.index-leaf': IndexLeafPayload
  }
}
```

After this declaration:

- `jobManager.enqueue('agent.task', payload)` is compile-time type-checked
- Renaming a type surfaces every call site via the TypeScript error pipeline
- Wrong payload shape is a compile error

## Transactional enqueue (`enqueueTx`)

`enqueue` persists the row on the bare connection — fine when the enqueue is the only write. When a business-state flip and the job INSERT must commit atomically (e.g. mark items `deleting` **and** enqueue the purge job), use the transactional variant inside a `DbService.withWriteTx` callback:

```ts
application.get('DbService').withWriteTx((tx) => {
  itemService.setStatusTx(tx, ids, 'deleting') // business write
  return jobManager.enqueueTx(tx, 'my.purge', { ids }) // job INSERT, same tx
})
```

Post-commit side effects (state publish, dispatch / delayed arming) are deferred one microtask past the synchronous transaction. On rollback the row never existed: the returned handle's `finished` never resolves, and an idempotency-key unique-index collision aborts the whole caller transaction. See the `enqueueTx` JSDoc for the full contract.

## Transactional schedule mutation (`registerJobScheduleTx` / `updateJobScheduleTx` + `syncJobScheduleTimerById`)

When a schedule row and a related business write must commit atomically, compose the transactional primitives inside a `DbService.withWriteTx` callback, then sync the timer after the transaction returns:

```ts
const { id } = application.get('DbService').withWriteTx((tx) => {
  const created = jobManager.registerJobScheduleTx(tx, { type: 'agent.task', ... }) // schedule row
  agentChannelService.replaceTaskSubscriptionsTx(tx, created.id, channelIds) // business write, same tx
  return created
})
jobManager.syncJobScheduleTimerById(id) // post-commit timer sync (create: always; update: when the patch carried trigger/enabled)
```

The `*Tx` primitives validate up front (handler, name, trigger semantics → `JOB_SCHEDULE_TRIGGER_INVALID`) and never touch the timer, so a rollback has zero timer side effects. Timer sync is the caller's explicit post-commit step — `enqueueTx`'s post-commit re-read cannot be reused here because its rollback test ("row absent") only holds for INSERT; an UPDATE rollback would read as committed and re-arm, resetting the interval phase. See the `registerJobScheduleTx` JSDoc for the full contract.

## Renderer-side consumers

The renderer never enqueues, cancels, or otherwise mutates jobs through the DataApi. It only observes job state read-only:

- `useJob(jobId)` → current `JobSnapshot` (status / counters / error / ...). Source: shared cache `jobs.state.${id}` with GET `/jobs/:id` as a cold-start fallback.
- `useJobProgress(jobId)` → fine-grained progress. Source: shared cache `jobs.progress.${id}` only.

Triggering a job is owned by the relevant business module in main:

1. The business service decides the semantics — which job type, what payload, queue, idempotency key, max attempts, timeout.
2. It calls `application.get('JobManager').enqueue(...)` directly.
3. If the renderer needs to initiate the work, the business module exposes a dedicated IPC route (e.g. the `knowledge.add_items` IpcApi route); the route handler internally calls `JobManager.enqueue(...)`.

Schedule mutations (CRUD / pause / resume / run-now) follow the same pattern: renderer → dedicated IpcApi route (e.g. `ai.agent.task.*` → `AgentJobsService`) → JobManager schedule APIs; schedule reads stay on the GET-only DataApi.

This keeps `JobRegistry`'s compile-time `JobPayloadOf<K>` type safety intact and prevents the renderer from depending on JobManager infrastructure details (queue names, retry policies, idempotency keys).
