# Chat Attachments

How a user's attached files reach the model on a chat turn.

**One rule, per attachment:** if the provider+model can take it as a native
input, send the **native file**; otherwise send its **extracted text**, inlined
and capped. The `read_file` tool only exists to page the overflow of large
text — it is never the *only* way the model sees content.

This is deliberate: visibility must not depend on the model choosing to call a
tool. A weak (or non-tool-calling) model still sees every attachment, and a
provider that handles a modality natively keeps doing so — no capability
regression.

## Routing matrix

Decided per file part in `prepareChatMessages`
(`src/main/ai/messages/attachmentRouting.ts`):

| Attachment | Native when | What the model receives |
|---|---|---|
| image | model is vision | native image part (inline) |
| image | non-vision, OCR finds text | OCR text, inline (capped) |
| image | non-vision, no OCR text (or OCR unconfigured/failed) | user-facing error; no provider request |
| pdf | provider+model native PDF | native PDF part (inline) |
| pdf | otherwise | extracted text, inline (capped) |
| office (`docx/xlsx/pptx/odf`) | — | extracted text, inline (capped) |
| text / code | — | decoded text, inline (capped) |
| extensionless | — | decoded text when content is text; otherwise unsupported note |
| audio | model and resolved endpoint are audio-capable | native audio part (inline) |
| audio | otherwise | short note ("can't process audio") |
| video | model and resolved endpoint are video-capable | native video part (inline) |
| video | otherwise | short note ("can't process video") |
| other (binary: zip/exe/…) | — | short note ("unsupported file type") |

- **Native** → the file part is left in place and materialized as a `data:` URL
  by `materializeNativeFilePart` (`src/main/ai/messages/fileProcessor.ts`), which
  also normalizes the `mediaType` to the on-disk MIME. The provider gets the real
  file as a user-message part. (The function is named for the boundary: provider
  File-API upload for large files would slot in behind the same signature.)
- Binary / unsupported types are **not** auto-decoded — they'd inline as mojibake
  — so they get a short note instead.
- A non-vision image only degrades to OCR text when OCR actually finds text.
  Otherwise (empty OCR result, unconfigured or failed OCR) attachment routing
  raises a localized error before opening the provider request. The user can
  select a vision-capable model or remove the image and try again.
- Any per-file failure (missing entry, parse error, failed materialization)
  degrades to a `[could not read this file].` note rather than dropping the
  file or failing the request.
- **Non-native** → the file part is replaced by its extracted text (see the
  cap below). The internal `fileEntryId` is never written into the prompt.

Only `fileEntryId`-backed (first-party chat) images enter the OCR path. Gateway /
external file parts (no `fileEntryId`) are still eagerly materialized, but
image/audio/video parts are omitted when native support is false. Other
gateway/external file types keep their existing behavior.

## The cap (the only context guard)

Extracted text is bounded so multi-turn context stays in control:

- text ≤ cap → inlined in full.
- text > cap → inline the first `cap` chars + a trailer:
  - tool-capable model: `[truncated N/total — call read_file("name", offset=N) for more]`
  - otherwise: `[truncated N/total]`

Default cap ≈ 8k chars/file (tunable).

## `read_file` — text-only overflow tool

`src/main/ai/tools/fileLookup.ts` + `tools/adapters/aiSdk/builtin/ReadFileTool.ts`.

- Input `{ filename, offset?, limit? }`. The `filename` is the model-facing
  **handle** (unique, normalized — see `collectFileAttachments`), resolved to an
  entry id against a per-request allow-list. The model never sees or guesses
  entry ids, and can only read files attached to the current conversation.
- Returns **text only** (extracted / OCR), paginated. Errors are sanitized to
  filename-level messages; details are logged, not returned.
- Exposed to tool-capable models whenever the request carries first-party file
  attachments (`applies: scope.hasFileAttachments`). It pages over-cap text; when
  everything inlines within the cap the model simply never needs to call it.
- Claude Code exposes the same read operation through the Cherry Assistant-only
  `assistant-files` MCP server. Its model-facing handles are stable, opaque
  hashes of FileEntry ids. The server rebuilds its allow-list from the current
  session transcript when each tool call runs, so deleting a message revokes
  access immediately. Ordinary Claude Code Agents receive neither this server
  nor its attachment manifest.
- Because native media is kept inline (never routed through the tool),
  `read_file` carries no media result — no `toModelOutput` base64 re-read, no
  resend re-materialization.

Cherry Assistant also gets approval-gated `save_attachment` from the same
session-scoped server. It writes only new paths inside the session workspace and
never overwrites an existing file. No attachment state or write tools are added
to the shared chat runtime or to ordinary Agents.

## Extraction & OCR

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| office/pdf/text → text | `extractDocumentText` (`src/main/ai/messages/attachmentTextExtraction.ts`) |
| image → text (non-vision) | `FileProcessingService.ocrImage` (`src/main/features/fileProcessing/`) |

`ai/` reaches OCR through the `FileProcessingService` rather than deep-importing
the feature, keeping processor/handler internals in that domain. Both
`extractDocumentText` and the OCR path are path-free and cache their result by
content version (30 min), so the eager every-turn pass over history doesn't
re-extract or re-OCR the same file. `extractDocumentText` reads bytes through
`FileManager.read` (PDF via `pdf-parse`, office via
`officeparser`/`word-extractor`, known text extensions via
`decodeTextWithAutoEncoding`, and extensionless text via
`decodeTextBufferIfText`) and dispatches on the `FileEntry` canonical `ext`.

## Capability resolution

`resolveNativeFileSupport`
(`src/main/ai/runtime/aiSdk/params/nativeFileSupport.ts`) derives the
"native" column from `(provider, model, resolved endpoint/runtime converter)`:
image rides on the model capability (`isVision`, `@shared/utils/model`);
audio/video require both the model capability and support from the selected AI
SDK converter. PDF additionally requires a first-party provider
(`supportsNativePdf`). There is no `pdf-compatibility` middleware — native PDFs
pass through inline, non-native PDFs go through extraction.

## Invariants

- Content visibility never depends on a tool call.
- `fileEntryId` never reaches the model (filename in, filename out).
- Native modalities keep provider-native handling.
- Known non-vision models never receive native image parts.
- Per-turn context is bounded by the cap.
